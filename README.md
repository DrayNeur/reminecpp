## ReMineCPP

> This project intends to replicate the Minecraft: Java Edition client to communicate with Minecraft JE servers.

### Why ?

This is a project that was for a while in my mind that I wanted to make, first of all to optimise the gameplay, yes minecraft is coded in Java which is very slow language compared to C++ and wanted to prevents crashes and lags that can occur using the Java Edition.

Currently implemented:
- Microsoft account authentification
- Handshake
